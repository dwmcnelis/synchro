Roberto Martinez has assured Newcastle and Norwich that Everton will protect the integrity of the Barclays Premier League by carrying the fight to Sunderland.
Should Everton perform in the same abject way as they did at Leicester on Saturday, Sunderland will secure the victory that will preserve their top flight status and, in the process, they will relegate Newcastle and Norwich.
Everton’s form in the league has been lamentable for the past two months – a sign of how bad things have been comes from the statistic they have had 70 on-target shots against them in their last two away matches at Leicester and Liverpool – and Martinez is on the brink.

The clamour amongst supporters for The Catalan to be replaced has intensified and it is inevitable there will be more protests against him at The Stadium of Light but Martinez is not paying any attention to the noise and is demanding a response from his players.
‘It’s a huge, huge game – and not just for what Sunderland are playing for,’ said Martinez. ‘From our point of view, we want a reaction to Leicester. It’s no such thing as winning players back – two weeks ago we had a really good determined performance against Bournemouth.

We always want to get something from every game but now our focus goes to tomorrow and we need to match the intensity.
‘Sunderland have got a very good home record in the last six games, so we know what we will face and have to be at our very best. The only thing that matters is to avoid any distraction. We won’t make mistake of losing attention of only thing that matters – that’s Sunderalnd.

‘You mention integrity of the competition and that’s why it is all we are focused on. Sunderland have found a winning formula and what’s important at this stage is carrying momentum. Then you get a feeling of nothing to lose.
‘It’s when you drop intensity and are just going through games but they are on the up – they showed that by beating Chelsea. There’s a real feeling of positive achievement at Sunderalnd and we will have to match that. We will learn our lessons from Leicester.’
Martinez, who will have Ramiro Funes Mori available after suspension and hopes Gareth Barry will be recovered from a groin problem, added: ‘We have to react as a team.
The biggest disappointment was we found the winning feeling against Bournemouth, which I thought was stylish performance with lot of character and guts. Against Leicester we got caught up in that celebration environment and clearly that cannot happen tomorrow.’
It is inevitable that there will be more protests against Martinez at The Stadium of Light on Wednesday
